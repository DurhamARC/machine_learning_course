## How to use
All of the exercises and slides are Jupyter notebooks run through Google's Colab service.
You can run all of these by clicking on a cell and then pressing "Shift + Enter" or clicking the "Play" button.
You can edit the code by double-clicking on a cell.
You can reevaluate the code after editing to see the updated output.
Output such as text and images automatically displayed, which is especially useful when outputting graphs or visualisations.
